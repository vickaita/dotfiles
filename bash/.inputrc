# Readline configuration for bash
# This file configures the GNU Readline library used by bash and other programs

# Use emacs-style key bindings (default, but explicit is good)
set editing-mode emacs

# Completion behavior
set show-all-if-ambiguous on          # Show completions immediately if ambiguous
set show-all-if-unmodified on         # Show completions even without modification
set completion-ignore-case on         # Case-insensitive completion
set mark-symlinked-directories on     # Add trailing slash to symlinked directories
set visible-stats on                  # Append file type indicator (*, /, @, =, |)
set colored-stats on                  # Color completions by file type
set colored-completion-prefix on      # Color the common prefix in completions

# Better completion display
set menu-complete-display-prefix on   # Show common prefix before cycling through completions
set page-completions off              # Don't paginate completions
set completion-query-items 200        # Ask before showing if more than 200 items

# History behavior
set history-preserve-point on         # Keep cursor position when navigating history
set revert-all-at-newline on          # Revert all changes to history lines when pressing Enter

# Better line editing
set enable-bracketed-paste on         # Handle pasted text as a single unit
set skip-completed-text on            # Skip over completed text when tab-completing

# Key bindings (most are default in emacs mode, but listed for clarity)
# Note: Ctrl-X Ctrl-R terminal reset from zsh can't be replicated in readline

# History search (incremental)

"\C-b": backward-char                 # Ctrl-B: backward char

# Deletion
